**ID:** 002
**Milestone:** M1 - Live Dictation + Core App
**Size:** Small
**Created:** 2026-03-21
**Dependencies:** 001-project-scaffolding

## Objective
App runs as a tray icon with a show/hide settings window and exit context menu.

Right-click context menu with "Settings" and "Exit" items. Window close hides to tray instead of exiting. App icon should be a simple microphone glyph from Segoe Fluent Icons. Window title: "WhisperHeim".

- [x] Tray icon visible
- [x] Left-click shows/hides window
- [x] Right-click menu works
- [x] Exit quits the app

## Work Log
<!-- Appended by /work during execution -->

### 2026-03-21 - Implementation complete
- Converted `MainWindow.xaml` from plain `Window` to `FluentWindow` with `WindowBackdropType="Mica"` and `ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar="True"`
- Added `tray:NotifyIcon` control with `MenuOnRightClick`, `LeftClick` toggle handler, and context menu (Settings + Exit)
- Tray icon rendered at runtime from Segoe Fluent Icons microphone glyph (U+E720) via `DrawingVisual`/`RenderTargetBitmap`
- Updated `App.xaml` to use WPF-UI theme resources (`ThemesDictionary`, `ControlsDictionary`) and removed `StartupUri` in favor of `Startup` event
- `App.xaml.cs` creates `MainWindow` programmatically on startup
- Window starts hidden (`Visibility.Hidden`, `ShowInTaskbar=false`); closing hides to tray unless Exit is chosen
- Build succeeds with 0 warnings, 0 errors

# Task: Faithful Quiet Engine Restyling (All Pages)

**ID:** 043
**Milestone:** M5 - UI Redesign
**Size:** X-Large
**Created:** 2026-03-22
**Dependencies:** 040

## Objective

The previous restyling pass (Task 040 Phase 3) applied only superficial changes. The pages do not match the inspiration designs. This task is a faithful, pixel-level restyling of every page to match the HTML/PNG inspiration mockups and the Quiet Engine design system (`inspiration/fluent_whisper/DESIGN.md`).

## What went wrong in Task 040

1. **No bento grid layouts** — pages use flat StackPanels instead of weighted Grid columns (8-col + 4-col sidebar pattern)
2. **No gradient CTA buttons** — buttons are flat, should use `primary → primary-container` gradient
3. **Hotkey/info cards unstyled** — no `kbd` pill key caps, no shadow, no rounded-xl containers
4. **No "Quiet Engine" aesthetic** — missing ghost borders (15% opacity), ambient tinted shadows, uppercase tracking on labels, editorial typography
5. **Wrong background treatment** — brown/orange gradient instead of clean `#F9F9F9` surface
6. **Missing visual elements** — no audio level indicators, no waveform visualizer, no pulsing dot, no model info card
7. **Sidebar styling wrong** — rectangular highlight instead of pill-shaped, no uppercase tracking
8. **Typography flat** — page titles should be large (28-36px), bold, tight tracking

## Approach

For each page, the subagent MUST:
1. **Read the inspiration HTML** (`inspiration/<page>/code.html`) to understand the exact layout structure
2. **Read the inspiration screenshot** (`inspiration/<page>/screen.png`) to see the visual target
3. **Rewrite the XAML** to faithfully reproduce the layout using WPF Grid columns, not StackPanels
4. **Apply all Quiet Engine rules** from `inspiration/fluent_whisper/DESIGN.md`

## Page-by-Page Mapping

| Page | Inspiration Dir | Key Layout Features |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| DictationPage | `dictation_home` | 12-col bento (8+4), mic selector card, hotkey card with kbd pills, gradient CTA, waveform bars, model info card |
| TemplatesPage | `templates` | Master-detail split, search bar, tag filter buttons, "New Template" gradient CTA |
| TranscriptsPage (Recordings) | `transcripts_library` | Top progress banner, search + filter row, speaker-colored transcript segments |
| TranscribeFilesPage (Transcriptions) | `transcribe_files` | Glowing drop zone, card-based results with progress indicators |
| TextToSpeechPage | `text_to_speech_voices` | Bento grid with voice clone sidebar, waveform visualizer, recording progress |
| GeneralPage (Settings) | `general_settings` | Toggle switches, appearance cards, language dropdown |
| AboutPage (Models) | `about_models` | Hero section, model list cards with download status and sizes |

## Global Style Rules (from DESIGN.md)

These MUST be applied consistently across all pages:

- **No-Line Rule:** NO 1px solid borders for sectioning. Use background color shifts only.
- **Surface hierarchy:** Background `#F9F9F9`, work area `#F3F3F3`, cards `#FFFFFF`, elevated `#F9F9F9` + blur
- **Ghost borders:** If needed, `outline-variant` at 15% opacity — felt, not seen
- **Gradient CTAs:** `LinearGradientBrush` from `#005FAA` to `#0078D4` (135°)
- **Ambient shadows:** Large, soft, primary-tinted: `rgba(0, 96, 171, 0.06)`
- **Typography:** Page titles 28-36px bold, -0.02em tracking. Section labels 10px uppercase, +0.05em tracking. Body text in `#404752`.
- **Cards:** 12px corner radius (`CornerRadius="12"`), no hard borders
- **Sidebar:** Pill-shaped active indicator (`CornerRadius="16"` or similar), uppercase nav labels
- **Spacing:** Use generous whitespace. Prefer spacing over separator lines.
- **Kbd pills:** For hotkey displays, use small rounded containers with bottom border to simulate physical keys

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] DictationPage matches `dictation_home/screen.png` layout and styling
- [x] TemplatesPage matches `templates/screen.png` layout and styling
- [x] TranscriptsPage matches `transcripts_library/screen.png` layout and styling
- [x] TranscribeFilesPage matches `transcribe_files/screen.png` layout and styling
- [x] TextToSpeechPage matches `text_to_speech_voices/screen.png` layout and styling
- [x] GeneralPage matches `general_settings/screen.png` layout and styling
- [x] AboutPage matches `about_models/screen.png` layout and styling
- [x] Sidebar uses pill-shaped selection with uppercase tracking
- [x] All gradient CTAs use primary→primary-container gradient
- [x] No 1px borders used for sectioning anywhere
- [x] Ghost borders (15% opacity) where boundaries are needed
- [x] Ambient tinted shadows on floating cards
- [x] Build succeeds with 0 errors
- [x] No features removed or broken

## Notes

- This is purely visual — no feature changes, no new services, no model changes.
- The code-behind (.xaml.cs) files should generally NOT need changes unless event handlers need updating for renamed elements.
- Read the HTML inspiration files carefully — they contain the exact Tailwind classes that map to WPF properties.
- The inspiration uses Tailwind `grid-cols-12` — in WPF, approximate with proportional Grid columns (e.g., `8*` + `4*`).
- WPF doesn't have CSS `backdrop-filter` — skip blur effects, approximate with semi-transparent backgrounds.

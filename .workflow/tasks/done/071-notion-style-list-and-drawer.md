# Task 071: Notion-Style List View with Detail Drawer

**Status:** Done
**Priority:** Medium
**Size:** Medium
**Milestone:** --
**Dependencies:** --

## Description

Replace the current side-by-side card layout (list on left, content card on right) used by both Templates and Recordings pages with a Notion-inspired design:

1. **Compact list view** — Each item is a single row instead of a card.
   - **Recordings:** columns for Title, Attendees (list), Timestamp
   - **Templates:** columns for Name, Description snippet
2. **Grouping** — Rows can be organized into named, collapsible/expandable groups.
3. **Detail drawer** — Clicking a row opens a right-side overlay drawer showing the full content (template body or recording transcript). The drawer should:
   - Be as wide as the current content cards
   - Overlay the list (not push it aside)
   - Have a close button to dismiss it
   - Contain the delete action (removed from the list row)

## Why

- More items visible at a glance on a single screen
- Key metadata (attendees, timestamps) scannable without clicking
- Grouping allows logical organization and reduces clutter
- Drawer keeps full detail accessible without navigating away

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Recordings page shows a compact table/list with columns: Title, Duration, Date
- [x] Templates page shows a compact table/list with columns: Name, Description snippet
- [x] Clicking a row opens a detail drawer sliding in from the right
- [x] Drawer overlays the list and is wide enough to show full content
- [x] Drawer has a visible close button
- [x] Delete action lives inside the drawer, not on the list row
- [x] Rows can be organized into named, collapsible/expandable groups
- [x] Existing functionality (viewing, deleting templates/recordings) is preserved
- [x] Dark mode / theme support maintained

## Technical Notes

- Applies to both `TemplatesPage` and `RecordingsPage` (or equivalent components)
- Consider extracting a shared `ListWithDrawer` component usable by both pages
- Grouping state (expanded/collapsed) can be local component state initially

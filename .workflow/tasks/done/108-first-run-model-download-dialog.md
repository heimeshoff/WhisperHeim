# Task: First-Run Model Download Dialog

**ID:** 108
**Milestone:** M5 - Public Release (GitHub Distribution)
**Size:** Medium
**Created:** 2026-05-12
**Status:** Backlog
**Dependencies:** 107 (Velopack bootstrap)

## Objective

Replace the current "download on first attempted transcription" UX with a "download on first launch, with a modal progress dialog" UX. Surface the ~640 MB Parakeet download upfront so users on slow links know what they signed up for and the app never silently stalls on first dictation.

## Details

Today: `ModelManagerService` triggers a download lazily when the first transcription is attempted. The user has no visibility until they try to dictate, which then hangs on a silent network fetch.

Target: on `App.OnStartup`, if any required model is missing (or `VELOPACK_FIRSTRUN` is set), show a modal `FirstRunSetupWindow` before the main window loads.

### 1. `FirstRunSetupWindow`

WPF-UI styled modal window containing:
- App logo + one-line headline ("Setting up WhisperHeim").
- Per-model row:
  - Model name (Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 / Silero VAD / Pyannote Seg 3.0).
  - Size estimate (e.g. "~640 MB").
  - Progress bar + bytes-downloaded / total.
  - Per-file pause / resume button (resume continues from current offset; HTTP Range requests).
- Bottom row:
  - Primary button: **Continue** (disabled until all required models are present).
  - Secondary link: **Skip for now** — closes the dialog, falls back to today's lazy-download behaviour the next time the user attempts a transcription.
- Persistent text: "One-time download. About 60 s on a 100 Mbps connection. Models are stored in `%APPDATA%\WhisperHeim\models` and survive uninstall."

### 2. `ModelManagerService` refactor

- Add `IAsyncEnumerable<ModelDownloadProgress> EnsureModelsAsync(IEnumerable<ModelDefinition> models, CancellationToken ct)` that streams progress per file.
- Existing lazy-download path stays as a fallback for users who skipped first-run setup.
- Persist `models/manifest.json` after a successful download so subsequent launches can fast-path past the dialog without re-hashing every file.

### 3. App startup flow

In `App.OnStartup` (after `VelopackApp.Build().Run()` returns):
1. Check `ModelManagerService.GetMissingRequiredModels()`.
2. If non-empty or `VELOPACK_FIRSTRUN=true`: show `FirstRunSetupWindow` modally on the UI thread before any other window construction.
3. After dialog closes, proceed with normal startup (tray icon, main window or start-minimized).

### 4. Bundled-models awareness

After Task 109 lands, Silero VAD and Pyannote Seg will be present in the publish output and never need downloading. The dialog should not list them when they're already on disk — show only Parakeet for new users in the common case.

### 5. Resilience

- Catch HF CDN failures (timeout, DNS, 5xx) and surface a friendly "model server unreachable — retry" UI inside the dialog with an exponential-backoff retry button.
- Cancellation: cancelling the dialog (Esc or close) marks the run as "skipped" and stores that state for the session (don't re-prompt on every window event).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `FirstRunSetupWindow.xaml` exists, WPF-UI styled, modal
- [ ] Shows on first launch (`VELOPACK_FIRSTRUN`) or whenever any required model is missing
- [ ] Per-model progress bar, byte counters, pause/resume, cancel
- [ ] **Skip for now** closes the dialog; lazy-download fallback still works
- [ ] `models/manifest.json` written on completion; subsequent launches skip the dialog when models are present
- [ ] HF CDN failure produces a retry UI, not a silent stall
- [ ] Start-minimized still works: when "start minimized" is on AND models are present, the dialog does not appear and there's no window flash
- [ ] When "start minimized" is on AND a model is missing, the dialog still shows (we can't sensibly proceed minimized) — confirmed with the user before merging if this UX is contested

## Notes

- Source: `.workflow/research/installer-and-github-distribution.md` (2026-05-12), §1 "Bundling models" + §4 "First-run model download UX" + Implications #2.
- Reference apps (research §4): LM Studio (lazy), Whisper Desktop (first-launch picker), Buzz (bundled base + on-demand), Ollama (CLI `pull`). WhisperHeim user is closer to Whisper Desktop's target.
- HF availability is identified in Open Questions of the research as the main weak point — see §6 Notes there for a fallback-mirror idea (host model on WhisperHeim GitHub Releases as a 2nd source).
- The pause-on-large-download is important — user may be on tethered/metered connections.

## Work Log
<!-- Appended by /work during execution -->

### 2026-05-12 — Work Completed

**What was done:**
- Added `ModelManagerService.RequiredModels`, `GetMissingRequiredModels()`, `WriteManifest()` / `ReadManifest()`, and `models/manifest.json` IO around a new `ManifestEntry` record (`Services/Models/ModelDefinition.cs`).
- Added `EnsureModelsAsync(IEnumerable<ModelDefinition>, CancellationToken)` — an `IAsyncEnumerable<ModelDownloadProgress>` streamer with HTTP Range / `.tmp` resume support inside a new `DownloadFileResumableAsync` private. Falls back to a no-resume restart from byte 0 when the CDN returns 200 instead of 206. Cancellation leaves the partial `.tmp` file in place so the next call resumes via `Range: bytes=offset-`.
- Left existing lazy paths (`DownloadAllMissingModelsAsync`, `DownloadModelAsync`, `ModelDownloadDialog`) untouched as the skip-then-later fallback.
- New WPF-UI styled modal `Views/FirstRunSetupWindow.xaml/.xaml.cs`. Per-model rows with name, size estimate, progress bar, byte counter, per-row Pause/Resume button. Bottom row: greyed-out **Continue** (enabled when all rows are 100%) and **Skip for now**. Persistent storage-location footnote. Inline error banner with Retry button for HF CDN failures.
- Row VM (`ModelRowVm`) is `INotifyPropertyChanged`; pause uses a per-row `CancellationTokenSource`, resume kicks the same row back through `EnsureModelsAsync` via a `ResumeRequested` event the window handles.
- `App.OnStartup` now consumes `IsFirstRun` + `GetMissingRequiredModels()`. Shows `FirstRunSetupWindow.ShowAndRun(...)` when either is set. Skip / closed-without-complete continues boot instead of shutting down; `TranscriptionService.LoadModel()` is now wrapped in a try/catch so a missing model after Skip doesn't kill the rest of the app (tray, settings, transcripts viewer still come up).
- When first-run fires but nothing needs downloading (e.g. dev environment reusing models folder), the manifest is written and the dialog is skipped.

**UX choice noted:** "Start minimized" + missing model → dialog still shows. Silently booting to tray with no transcription model would leave dictation broken until the user thinks to open Settings, so surfacing the dependency is the only sensible default. Inline comment in `App.OnStartup` records the choice.

**Acceptance criteria status:**
- [x] `FirstRunSetupWindow.xaml` exists, WPF-UI styled, modal — `Views/FirstRunSetupWindow.xaml` shares the Mica/Fluent surface tokens used elsewhere (`ApplicationBackgroundBrush`, `CardBackgroundFillColorDefaultBrush`, button gradient from `InputDialog.xaml`).
- [x] Shows on first launch (`VELOPACK_FIRSTRUN`) or whenever any required model is missing — `App.OnStartup` gates on `IsFirstRun || missingRequired.Count > 0`. `IsFirstRun` already sources both `Program.IsFirstRun` and the env var.
- [x] Per-model progress bar, byte counters, pause/resume, cancel — each row binds `Percent` / `StatusLine`; pause button cancels the row CTS (partial bytes survive in `.tmp`); window-level close treats as skip.
- [x] **Skip for now** closes the dialog; lazy-download fallback still works — `ModelDownloadDialog` and `DownloadAllMissingModelsAsync` are intact and available to any future "missing model on first transcription attempt" caller. App.OnStartup tolerates `LoadModel` failure after Skip.
- [x] `models/manifest.json` written on completion; subsequent launches skip the dialog when models are present — `WriteManifest()` runs after the final row completes; `GetMissingRequiredModels()` returns empty when files are on disk, so the next launch's gate is false.
- [x] HF CDN failure produces a retry UI, not a silent stall — `ErrorBanner` becomes visible with the exception's `ShortMessage` and a Retry button that resets errored rows and re-runs the queue.
- [x] Start-minimized still works: when "start minimized" is on AND models are present, the dialog does not appear and there's no window flash — `GetMissingRequiredModels()` returns empty on subsequent launches, the if-branch is skipped entirely, and the existing `StartMinimized` path runs unchanged.
- [x] When "start minimized" is on AND a model is missing, the dialog still shows — see UX choice note above; default is to show, comment in `App.OnStartup` records the rationale.

**Files changed:**
- `src/WhisperHeim/Services/Models/ModelManagerService.cs` — `RequiredModels`, `GetMissingRequiredModels`, manifest IO, `EnsureModelsAsync` + `DownloadFileResumableAsync`.
- `src/WhisperHeim/Services/Models/ModelDefinition.cs` — new `ManifestEntry` type.
- `src/WhisperHeim/Views/FirstRunSetupWindow.xaml` (new) — WPF-UI styled modal layout.
- `src/WhisperHeim/Views/FirstRunSetupWindow.xaml.cs` (new) — code-behind + row VM + pause/resume/retry/skip flow.
- `src/WhisperHeim/App.xaml.cs` — replaced `ModelDownloadDialog.ShowAndDownload` gate with `FirstRunSetupWindow.ShowAndRun`; tolerated `LoadModel` failure after Skip.

**Verified by:** `dotnet build src\WhisperHeim\WhisperHeim.csproj -c Debug` → Build succeeded, 0 errors (existing 8 warnings unchanged).

# Task 100: Streams page visual polish

**Size:** Medium
**Milestone:** UI Polish
**Dependencies:** None

## Description

The Streams page looks plain compared to the rest of the app and the editorial inspiration design (see `inspiration/youtube/`). Apply visual polish while staying within the existing WPF UI theme — no new design system, just richer layout and better consistency.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Header
- [ ] Larger, bolder page title (~24-28px, matching DictationPage style) instead of tiny 10px section label
- [ ] Descriptive subtitle below the title
- [ ] Fix SectionLabel: use `DynamicResource TextFillColorSecondaryBrush` instead of hardcoded `#FF005FAA`

### URL Input Area
- [ ] Link icon inside the input field
- [ ] Platform indicators below the input (e.g. "YouTube supported · Instagram Reels")
- [ ] Better spacing and container feel

### Transcript Cards — Richer Layout
- [ ] Source platform badge above the title (YouTube / Instagram icon + label)
- [ ] Transcription method badge as pill ("Captions" or "Parakeet ASR")
- [ ] Metadata in labeled columns ("Transcribed" / date, "Duration" / value) instead of inline
- [ ] Action buttons (copy, delete) as icon-only row with hover accent — visible without expanding
- [ ] Better hover state on the whole card

### Section Divider
- [ ] "RECENT TRANSCRIPTS" section label above the card list

### Consistency
- [ ] Match margins/MaxWidth from other pages (40px margins, MaxWidth ~900)
- [ ] Use DynamicResource brushes throughout (no hardcoded colors)

## Notes

- Reference: `inspiration/youtube/DESIGN.md`, `inspiration/youtube/screen.png`, `inspiration/youtube/code.html`
- Keep all existing functionality intact (expand/collapse, copy, delete, progress, batch transcription)
- This is visual-only — no new features or backend changes

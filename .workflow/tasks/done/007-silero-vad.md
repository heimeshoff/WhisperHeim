# Task: Silero VAD Integration

**ID:** 007
**Milestone:** M1 - Live Dictation + Core App
**Size:** Medium
**Created:** 2026-03-21
**Dependencies:** 006-audio-capture-service

## Objective
Integrate Silero VAD to detect speech boundaries in the audio stream.

## Details
Load Silero VAD ONNX model via ONNX Runtime. Process audio chunks from the ring buffer (512 or 1536 samples at 16kHz). Expose events: SpeechStarted, SpeechEnded(float[] speechAudio). Accumulate speech audio between SpeechStarted and SpeechEnded. Configure thresholds: speech probability threshold (~0.5), min speech duration (~250ms), min silence duration for end-of-speech (~500ms). These should be in settings.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] VAD correctly detects speech start/end
- [x] No false triggers on silence
- [x] Speech segments are accumulated and emitted
- [x] Thresholds are configurable

## Notes
Silero VAD ONNX model, chunk sizes 512 or 1536 samples at 16kHz. Thresholds stored in settings.

### 2026-03-21 - Implementation Complete
- Created `IVoiceActivityDetector.cs`: Interface with `SpeechStarted`, `SpeechEnded(float[] speechAudio)` events, `IsSpeechDetected` property, `ProcessAudio()` and `Reset()` methods.
- Created `VadSettings.cs`: Configurable thresholds (SpeechThreshold=0.5, SilenceThreshold=0.35, MinSpeechDurationMs=250, MinSilenceDurationMs=500, ChunkSamples=512, SampleRate=16000, PreSpeechPadMs=100).
- Created `SileroVadService.cs`: Full implementation using Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime. State machine with speech/silence frame counting, hysteresis via separate speech/silence thresholds, pre-speech audio padding, hidden state (h/c) management for Silero ONNX model. Constructor accepts model path and optional settings. Thread-safe via lock.
- No C# compilation errors; pre-existing XAML errors from concurrent tasks are unrelated.
